             Roll up some gauze or cloth and put it into the patient's hand.
             Place the arm into the splint such that the entire portion from
             elbow to hand is supported. Drape two cravats over the top with
             one above and one below the break site.

            Take a third triangular bandage and tie a knot at the 90 degree
            corner. The knot will serve as a "pocket" in which to place the elbow.

            Drape the bandage under the splint and across the shoulder

            the splint to the same shoulder as the pocket/elbow.
