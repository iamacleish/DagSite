      <h2>C-Spine/Packaging</h2>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Is there need for SMR?  Any red flags – Fall > 20 feet, Age > 65,
            head trauma
           </li>
          <li>
            Ask if anything hurts and then check as much neck and back as we
            can reach.  Spine doesn’t hurt
          </li>
          <li>
            Check does everything work – flex fingers, wrists, ankles and
            toes.  Touch extremities for feeling.  Tingling? Everything works.
          </li>
          <li>If any of above fails then SMR required.</li>

          <li>CMSTP – Color, Motion, Sensitivity, Temperature, Perfusion</li>
          <li>
            Start Manual C Spine (person 1) and Call 911 (person 2).  Select
            person to do manual C-Spine and instruct them without actually
            touching the subjects head.
          </li>
          <li>Apply C Collar
            </p>
          		Measure distance from chin plan to shoulder/neck plane – use fingers.
          		Adjust C-collar to correct extension – to holes completely covered by fingers.
          		Slip collar under subjects neck to see tab.
          		Swing collar around so centerline meets center of chin.
          		Hold collar in place with right hand and push near side in and then pull Velcro tight to
              snug up collar on both sides.  Check if near side is pulled in enough and far side curves
              around. Don’t jostle head/neck.
          		Ask head person if the collar is straight.
          		Head person keeps holding head.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Lay out Vacu-Splint, release near side buckles, and deflate if not already
            and even out filling.   Make sure there is enough filling around
            the head area.  Use red valve at bottom and replace cap when done.
            Inflate until stiff – maybe 15 pumps.
          </li>
          <li>
            Instruct helpers in roll technique.  Instruct head guy on what he
            does.  Move subject arm to sort of above head.  Top guys grab
            shoulders and hip or waist.  Bottom guy overlaps middle arm with me
             and far pant leg. Head guys calls roll.  Roll up on side against
             helpers legs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do back inspection while subject is up on side; spine, butt, legs,
            and shoulders. And blood and back.
          </li>
          <li>
            Far guy pushes VS against subject and at 45 degree angle – check
            VS is stiff.  Roll subject down/over onto VS and VS flat to ground.
          </li>
          <li>
            Align subject on VS.  Bottom guy grabs inner part of pants of both
            legs.  Two upper guys grab shoulder and waist.   Slide down 6
            inches and in to alignment.  Head guy calls the numbers and slides
            on three.  Then the same but slide up and aligned.  OK to move feet
            into final alignment.
          </li>
          <li>Keep talking to subject and telling him what is going on.</li>
          <li>
            Strap subject in and snug him/her up.
            <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
          	  <li>Deflate matt.</li>
          	  <li>Click in buckles.</li>
          		<li>Start at top and snug up belt – push and pull belt so not to pull VS at buckles. </li>
          		<li>Place excess belt at bottom between subject’s legs then snug up bottom to top. </li>
          		<li>Use knees to push sides of VS into subject for tight fit. Roll back around feet for access during final CMSTP (not now). </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Secure head.  Head guy keeps holding head.  Snug up the VS around
            the head and hands of the head guy.  Roll back top of VS but keep
            touch on face at about cheek level.
          </li>
          <li>
            My hands go over outside of VS at head, head guys hands can slip
            out and then over mine to put him on outside of VS around head.
            He holds patient head tight and I do final snug up of VS on
            subjects head.   Head guy keeps holding.  Check rest of VS
            snugness.  I call for 15 pumps to harden VS.  Replace red cap
            on valve.
          </li>
          <li>Check head support is good.</li>
          <li>
            Tape up Vacu-Splint over patient head.  18+ inches of tape and crimp in
            the middle.  Tape head and both sides to the VS.
          </li>
          <li>Do full CMSTP again.</li>
          <li>
           Lift with back straight and eye to eye contact of 4 cross lifters.
          </li>
          <li>Done.</li>
